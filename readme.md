# Git Example
This is a repo for trying out Git and GitHub.

## What is Git?
Git is a **version control** software. It maintains different versions of our code/project as well as a history of our changes.

## What is a commit?
In Git, a commit is a checkpoint of the changes we made in a project. We can review all previous commits and revert back to any point in time we may want to. It's important to put clear commit messages, so you know what changes had occurred there.

## What is a branch?
A branch is a different version of our code that comes from a certain commit. Changes that occur on a separate branch don't affect the main or any other branches. They're independent until they are merged into other branches.
